1. Backward Incompatible Changes
========================================

Core:
  . The ext_skel utility has been completely redesigned with new options and 
    some old options removed. This is now written in PHP and has no external 
	dependencies.
  . Support for BeOS has been dropped.

BCMath:
  . All warnings thrown by BCMath functions are now using PHP's error handling.
	  Formerly some warnings have directly been written to stderr.

Standard:
  . getimagesize() and related functions now report the mime type of BMP images
	  as image/bmp instead of image/x-ms-bmp, since the former has been registered
		with the IANA (see RFC 7903).
