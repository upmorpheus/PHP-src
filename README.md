# The PHP Interpreter

PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to
web development. Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your
blog to the most popular websites in the world. PHP is distributed under the PHP
License v3.01.

## Documentation

The PHP manual is available at [php.net/docs](https://php.net/docs).

## Installation

### Prebuilt packages and binaries

Prebuilt packages and binaries can be used to get up and running fast with PHP.

For Windows, the PHP binaries can be obtained from
[windows.php.net](https://windows.php.net). After extracting the archive the
`*.exe` files are ready to use.

For other systems, see the [installation chapter](https://php.net/install).

### Building PHP from source

On \*nix systems:

    ./buildconf
    ./configure
    make
    make test

See `./configure -h` and `make -h` for configuration options. For example, the
`-j` option allows parallel execution of the build recipes where `N` is the
number of available processor cores:

    make -j N

For Windows, see
[Build your own PHP on Windows](https://wiki.php.net/internals/windows/stepbystepbuild_sdk_2).

## PHP extensions

Extensions provide additional functionality on top of PHP. PHP consists of many
essential bundled extensions. Additional extensions can be found in the PHP
Extension Community Library - [PECL](https://pecl.php.net).

## Contributing

The PHP source code is located in the Git repository at
[git.php.net](https://git.php.net). Contributions are most welcome by forking
the [GitHub mirror repository](https://github.com/php/php-src) and sending a
pull request.

Discussions are done on GitHub, but depending on the topic can also be relayed
to the official PHP developer mailing list internals@lists.php.net.

New features require an RFC and must be accepted by the developers. See
[Request for comments - RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc) and
[Voting on PHP features](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/voting) for more information
on the process.

Bug fixes **do not** require an RFC but require a bug tracker ticket. Open a
ticket at [bugs.php.net](https://bugs.php.net) and reference the bug id using
`#NNNNNN`.

    Fix #55371: get_magic_quotes_gpc() throws deprecation warning

    After removing magic quotes, the get_magic_quotes_gpc function caused a
    deprecated warning. get_magic_quotes_gpc can be used to detect the
    magic_quotes behavior and therefore should not raise a warning at any time.
    The patch removes this warning.

Pull requests are not merged directly on GitHub. All PRs will be pulled and
pushed through [git.php.net](https://git.php.net). See
[Git workflow](https://wiki.php.net/vcs/gitworkflow) for more details.

### Guidelines for contributors

See further documents in the repository for more information on how to
contribute:

- [Contributing to PHP](/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [PHP coding standards](/CODING_STANDARDS)
- [Mailinglist rules](/docs/mailinglist-rules.md)
- [PHP release process](/docs/release-process.md)

## Testing

To run tests the `make test` is used after a successful compilation of the
sources. The `-j` option provides faster parallel execution based on the number
of cores (`N`):

    make -j N test

The [qa.php.net](https://qa.php.net) site provides more detailed info about
testing and quality assurance.
